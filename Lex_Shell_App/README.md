# Lex Shell App

Welcome to the Lex Shell App â€” your universal app launcher and starter kit.

This shell contains:
- `public/index.html`: A basic UI entry point
- `lex.config.json`: Config and bootstrapping commands
- `logs/`: Log files for audit, sync, and debug
- `LexMemory/`: Embedded assistant boot memory
- `LexAgent.js`: Lex bootstrap interface

Designed to align with lacycom1: prioritize system-wide optimization, scalability, and full-stack integration.
